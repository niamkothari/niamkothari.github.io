## Welcome to Niam Kothari's Website!

Computer Science and Philosophy Student at Duke University.

### Mission
My mission is to collect experiences and give them back to others. As a developer, this manifests in the applications I've built and the projects I hope to work on, and as a creator this manifests in the stories I tell through film and dance. 

As a prospective software engineer, I'm always on the search for opportunities to grow my skillset and immerse myself in the industry. I'm excited to bring a detail-oriented approach, time-tested ability to learn quickly, and relentless work ethic to any work environment I find myself in.
